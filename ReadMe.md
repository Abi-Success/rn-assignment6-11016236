cd fashion-app

#  Install the dependencies:
npm install

# Start the development server:

 Run the app on your emulator or physical device.


## Code Structure

# The main components of the app are:
HomeScreen.js: This is the main screen that displays the grid of clothing items.
Home.js: This is a reusable component that represents a single clothing item.
CartScreen.js: This screen displays the items in the user's cart.
CartContext.js: This is a context that manages the state of the shopping cart.



# The code follows a modular structure, with separate components for each major functionality. The HomeScreen.js component is responsible for rendering the main grid of clothing items, while the Home.js component handles the rendering of a single item. The CartContext.js file manages the state of the shopping cart, which is used by both the HomeScreen.js and CartScreen.js components.


# Usage
Upon launching the app, you will see the main Home screen with a grid of clothing items.
To add an item to the cart, tap the "+" icon on the item.
The total number of items in the cart will be displayed in a badge on the cart icon.
To view the cart, tap the cart icon in the top-right corner.
The Cart screen will display all the items you have added to the cart.
